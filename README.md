# Indusby

A super fast-paced prototype made in a night for the Grand Challenge hackathon hosted by the Government of Karnataka. It's a portal to facilitate distribution of industrial by-products from the source which are the industries to contractors which can use said waste for their further construction projects, facilitating a reuse cycle.

We used Ionic, React and Firebase to make this project.
